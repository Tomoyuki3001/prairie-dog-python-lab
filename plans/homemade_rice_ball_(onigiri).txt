Project: Homemade Rice Ball (Onigiri)
Difficulty: Easy

Steps:
- Cook rice according to package instructions (preferably short-grain Japanese rice) and let it cool slightly to a manageable temperature.
- Prepare your desired fillings (e.g., tuna mayo, salmon flakes, pickled plum, grilled chicken, etc.).
- Gather your tools: a bowl of water (for wetting hands), salt, and optionally plastic wrap or an onigiri mold.
- Wet your hands with water to prevent rice from sticking, then rub a small amount of salt onto your palms.
- Take a portion of cooked rice (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup) and gently press it into a disk in your palm.
- Place a small amount of your chosen filling in the center of the rice disk.
- Gather the edges of the rice around the filling to enclose it completely.
- Gently shape the rice into a triangle, sphere, or cylinder using both hands, applying light, firm pressure.
- Optionally, wrap the bottom or sides of the rice ball with a strip of nori (seaweed sheet).
- Repeat the process for additional rice balls.
