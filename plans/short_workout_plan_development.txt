Project: Short Workout Plan Development
Difficulty: Easy

Steps:
- Define your primary fitness goal (e.g., general fitness, strength, endurance, weight loss).
- Determine your available time per workout session (e.g., 20-30 minutes) and weekly frequency (e.g., 3-4 times/week).
- Select 2-3 dynamic warm-up exercises (e.g., arm circles, leg swings, jumping jacks) for 5 minutes.
- Choose 4-6 compound bodyweight exercises that target major muscle groups (e.g., squats, push-ups, lunges, plank, glute bridges).
- Decide on sets and repetitions for each exercise (e.g., 3 sets of 10-15 reps) or a time-based approach (e.g., 45 seconds on, 15 seconds off).
- Integrate 1-2 minutes of rest between sets or exercise circuits.
- Select 2-3 static cool-down stretches (e.g., hamstring stretch, triceps stretch) for 5 minutes.
- Schedule your workout days and rest days for optimal recovery and consistency.
- Plan for progressive overload by gradually increasing reps, sets, workout duration, or introducing variations as you get stronger.
