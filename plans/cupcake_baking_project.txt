Project: Cupcake Baking Project
Difficulty: Easy

Steps:
- Gather all ingredients (flour, sugar, eggs, butter, milk, baking powder, vanilla extract, salt) and tools (cupcake tin, liners, mixing bowls, whisk/mixer, measuring cups/spoons).
- Preheat oven to the specified temperature (e.g., 350°F/175°C) and line cupcake tin with paper liners.
- Combine dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt) in one bowl.
- Cream butter and sugar together in a separate bowl until light and fluffy.
- Beat in eggs one at a time into the butter-sugar mixture, then stir in vanilla extract.
- Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with milk, mixing until just combined (do not overmix).
- Fill cupcake liners about 2/3 full with batter.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
- Let cupcakes cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
- Prepare frosting (homemade or store-bought) once cupcakes are fully cooled.
- Frost and decorate the cupcakes as desired (e.g., sprinkles, edible glitter).
