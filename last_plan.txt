Project: Computer Science Study Plan
Difficulty: High

Steps:
- Define clear learning goals and specific areas of interest within CS (e.g., Web Development, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, Data Science).
- Assess current knowledge and identify foundational gaps (e.g., basic programming, discrete mathematics).
- Select core foundational subjects: Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Networking, and Databases.
- Choose a primary programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++) to master and practice regularly.
- Identify and gather learning resources: online courses (e.g., Coursera, edX, MIT OCW), textbooks, documentation, and coding platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank).
- Develop a structured study schedule with dedicated time slots for theory, practical coding, and problem-solving.
- Actively work on coding projects to apply theoretical knowledge and build a portfolio.
- Regularly practice algorithmic problem-solving to enhance logical thinking and coding efficiency.
- Engage with the CS community: participate in forums, join study groups, and attend webinars or meetups.
- Continuously review progress, refine goals, and adapt the study plan based on evolving interests and industry trends.
